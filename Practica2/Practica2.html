        <p ALIGN="left"> She'd take the world off my shoulders<p>
        If it was ever hard to move<p>
        She'd turn the rain to a rainbow<p>
        When I was living in the blue<p>
        Why then, if she is so perfect<p>
        Do I still wish that it was you?<p>
        Perfect don't mean that it's working<p>
        So what can I do? (Ooh)<p>
        <br>
        When you're out of sight<p>
        In my mind...</p></font>

        <p><center>Cause sometimes I look in her eyes</p>
        And that's where I find a glimpse of us<p>
        And I try to fall for her touch<p>
        But I'm thinking of the way it was<p>
        Said I'm fine and said I moved on<p>
        I'm only here passing time in her arms<p>
        Hoping I'll find<p>
        A glimpse of us</p></font>

        <p>Tell me he savors your glory<p>
        Does he laugh the way I did<p>
        Is this a part of your story?<p>
        One that I had never lived<p>
        Maybe one day you'll feel lonely<p>
        And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse<p>
        Maybe you'll start slipping slowly<p>
        And find me again</p></font>
